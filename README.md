# Flocabulary Code Challenge Write Up
F.E. Code Assignment

I want to take a moment and thank you for this code challenge. I honestly had a lot of fun figuring this out. 
This of course feels extremely validating in terms of continuing to work on these kinds of projects. So, whether you want to bring me in for subsequent interviews, or not. 
Thank you!!!

<h4>Things I did for the first time:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Used a precompiler; specifically, less.css. I'm sure I will get better with it as I use it more, but this was enough to give me a great appreciation for it. It is ddefinitely going to be part of my process moving forward.</li>
<li>Used a mix-in! How cool are they?!?</li>
<li>Set up a localhost to use for F.E. Dev... I've used it once before to test a stupid twilio app I made, but never I had to before for HTML/CSS stuff, f:/// was always sufficient, which leads me to....</li>
<li>Incorporated Adobe Typekit into a website. I've only ever used it for print work. </li>
<li>Used animate.css.. Suddenly I recognized a bunch of cool features I've seen on other websites.</li>
<li>Used jquery at all.... </li>
<li>Played with inline svgs. Ultimately, I didn't use them inline, I just called them as images and in a couple instances doctored them with Illustrator to match colors. </li>
</ol>

<h4>Things that I'm really excited about exploring from this</h4>
<ol>
<li>I read a bit about building an svg library and then calling that and then you can call stroke and fill from your stylesheet. Very cool and useful. I'll probably experiement a bit this weekend with that. </li>
<li>lots and lots of DOM manipulation, I can envision some really cool things that can be done with this.</li>
<li>Exploring react and getting better with JS. I think I want to try building some games or a parralax scrolling type site.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Things I got hung up on for the longest</h4>
<ol>
<li>Figuring out why Less.css and Adobe typekit were not working with F:///...</li>
<li>I missed an "s" in the declaring the "class" for one of the breadcrumb nav items read and reread it for an obscene amount of time before I caught it.</li>
</ol>
So there it is... This is definitely the most in depth F.E. type project that I've tackled and it's made me pretty stoked to work on more. 
Thank you! :-)
